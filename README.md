Role Variables
--------------

Variables below are used to control what the role does during a run.  You can find the defaults in `defaults/main.yml`.
- manage_users   # used to control whether this role is used or not.
- users_default_shell   # default shell for user unless one is specified.
- users_default_createhome   # creates a home directory for the user during creation.
- users_default_create_user_group  # creates groups based on user name. **If you disable this you must set the `group` for each user and the group must exist or created in `othergroups`**
- users_default_removehome   # When state is set to absent, also remove the users home directory

Users and groups you want to manage are all defined in the vars of the playbook.  This can be in group_vars, host_vars, or vars: in a play.  If you have the `users:` hash defined in two places such as `group_vars/all` and `host_vars/foo` and want both sets of users on the foo host you will want to add `hash_behaviour = merge` to your anisble.cfg to enable this.

Example Playbook
